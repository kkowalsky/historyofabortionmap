        <h2>An Overview</h2>
      <p>In 1973 the Supreme Court decided in the case of Roe v. Wade that states cannot interfere with abortion access during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, can only regulate the 2nd trimester to protect a woman's health, can only ban the 3rd trimester in cases where a woman's life is in jeopardy, and a woman's right to choose has the highest level of constitutional protection.
      <p>Since that decision, people and politicians against abortion have found different, sometimes elaborate, often confusing ways to restrict how and when a woman can have access to an abortion. 
        <h2>The Grades</h2>
<img src="img/image_2.jpg" width="100%" height="400px" align="center">
    <h2>Partial Birth</h2>
 <br><img src="img/image_1.jpg" width="400px" height="400px" class="image2"><p class="paragraph2">   <h2>Trigger laws</h2>
    <p>Due to Roe vs. Wade, it is illegal for a state to not provide abortions if the woman's life is endangered. However, many states still have laws which, while are unenforceable, are still on the books. As abortion became galvanizing political topic, some state legislators have even introduced laws which won't come into effect unless Roe vs. Wade is overturned.
   <p>These laws are nicknamed Trigger Laws: a law that is unenforceable and irrelevant in the present, but may achieve relevance and enforceability if a key change occurs. Because these laws aren't enacted until Roe is overturned, they can't be challenged or argued- which means the only way to overturn them will be after they're in effect and through the then-legislating body. By moving the debate on the laws to the legislators, it costs the state no money to defend the illegal legislation.
<h2>Counseling</h2><!-- <br><img src="img/image_1.jpg" width="400px" height="400px" class="image3"><p class="paragraph3"> -->
<h2>Waiting Period</h2>
<h2>Parental Consent</h2>
<h2>Ultrasound</h2>
    <p>The most recent type of legislation regarding abortion has been state's pushing for mandatory ultrasounds. Ultrasounds are a medically safe procedure that involve sending high frequency sound waves through the woman's body to create an image of the baby inside. If a woman is wants more information on her abortion, ultrasounds are a great tool and should be made available.
    <p>However, making the procedure mandatory makes it an unnecessary burden on women who don't want it.

       <p>Your Body, (Not) Your Choice is a collaboration of <a href="twitter.com/katiekowalsky">Katie Kowalsky</a>, <a href="twitter.com/DylanMoriarty">Dylan Moriarty</a>, and <a href="twitter.com/tolomaps">Robin Tolochko</a> as a project for Robert Roth and Carl Sackâ€™s Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization course at UW-Madison. Completed in December 2014. 
<br><br>
Many thanks to Robert Roth, Carl Sack, Rashauna Mead, Sam Matthews, John Czaplewski, etc. for their invaluable help!
<br><br>
This project was built with <a href="http://d3js.org/ ">D3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/queue">Queue</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/ ">jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/ ">Bootstrap</a>.

<h3>Data</h3> <!-- add links --><p>
Overview policy data was collected from the Guttmacher Institute <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf ">here</a>. The A-F grades for each state on the initial map view are from the <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/government-and-you/state-governments/ ">NARAL Pro-choice America's State Government</a> page and the methodology is available <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/government-and-you/who-decides/methodology.html ">here</a>. 
<br><br>
Most of the locations of abortion providers in the U.S. are from <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center ">Planned Parenthood</a> and the <a href="http://prochoice.org/think-youre-pregnant/find-a-provider/ ">National Abortion Federation</a> (NAF). Only those Planned Parenthoods that offer abortion services were included in the map. These locations were cross-checked with NAF's data to ensure that there were no duplicates. A few abortion providers are from <a href="http://www.gynpages.com/ ">GynPages</a> and <a href="http://www.abortionclinicpages.com/ ">abortionclinicpages.com</a>. We know that this is not a comprehensive list of abortion providers in the U.S., as a report from the Guttmacher Institute found that there were an estimated 1,720 abortion providers in the U.S. in 2011 (as opposed to the 607 abortion providers included in our map). However, we could not compile a complete list, as the Guttmacher Institute does not release this information due to confidentiality agreements with many providers. We believe that much of the discrepancy between our number and the complete number is due to hospitals and private physicians' offices that do not belong to the National Abortion Federation. If you have any leads on where we can get a complete list of abortion providers, please <a href="mailto:yourbodynotyourchoice@gmail.com ">contact us</a>. 
<br><br>
The locations of crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) come from <a href="http://birthright.org/">Birthright International</a> and <a href="http://www.heartbeatinternational.org/">Heartbeat International</a> networks. <a href="https://www.care-net.org/">Care-Net</a> also has an extensive network of CPCs but does not have a comprehensive list of their affiliates.
