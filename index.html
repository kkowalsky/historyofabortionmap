            OVERVIEW 
===================================-->


<!-- <div class = "letscenter"><img src = "img/OverviewMap_1.jpg" width="500px" height="341px" align="center"></div> -->
<p>Between complex laws, political jargon, and emotional fervor around the subject, abortion law is a very complex topic. There's a wealth of misinformation out there, and lack of cohesion between state laws makes it difficult to interpret the true national status of abortion rights.
<p>In this section, we hope to shed some light on the different means of abortion restriction and explain why they're considered controversial.
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The unifying element of these restrictions are that they interfere with a patients ability to feel control over the important decision related to their care. 
<p>In 1973 the supreme court decided in the case of Roe v. Wade that states cannot interfere with abortion access during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, can only regulate the 2ndtrimester to protect a woman's health, can only ban the 3rd trimester in cases where a woman's life is in jeopardy, and a woman's right to choose has the highest level of constitutional protection.
<p><div class = "letscenter"><img src="img/OverviewGraph_1.jpg"></div>
<p>Since that decision, states have pushed more and more legislation that restrict a woman's access to abortion within the confines of Roe v. Wade decision. This trend has become even more prominent over the years; there have been more laws passed restricting abortions between 2011-2013 than had been 2001-2010.

<!-- ==============================
            GRADES 
===================================-->
    <h2>The Grades</h2>
<!-- ==============================
            PROHIBITIONS 
===================================-->
<div class = chptrhead><h2>Prohibiting Laws</h2></div>
<h2>Partial Birth Abortions</h2>
<p>  In 2003 the “Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act” was passed, and four years later upheld by the Supreme Court. The law though grand sounding, only prohibits abortions via the “partial-birth abortion” procedure. Coined by the National Right to Life committee in 1995, it originally referred to a specific type of abortion that involved removing the fetus from the womb.<sup><a href = www.google.com> [1]</a></sup>
<p>In the legislation, however, the term doesn't refer to any precise medical procedure, but rather any abortion where the doctor “deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire head is outside the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother.” 
<p>The issue here is that the ban completely disregards cases where the woman's health may be at risk. In cases where the fetus develops an illness undetectable until the second trimester, procedures banned by this law are widely considered the safest way to end the pregnancy without damaging the woman's cervix. The negligence of the law is addressed in 32 states with exceptions, but in 29 those exceptions are only made when the woman's life is in danger. 
<!-- Trigger Laws-->
<h2>Trigger laws</h2>
<p>Due to Roe vs. Wade, it is illegal for a state to not provide abortions if the woman's life is endangered. However, many states still have laws which, while are unenforceable, are still on the books. As abortion became galvanizing political topic, some state legislators have even introduced laws which won't come into effect unless Roe vs. Wade is overturned.
<p><div class = "letscenter"><img src="img/OverviewMap_2.jpg"></div>
<p>These laws are nicknamed Trigger Laws: a law that is unenforceable and irrelevant in the present, but may achieve relevance and enforceability if a key change occurs. Because these laws aren't enacted until Roe is overturned, they can't be challenged or argued- which means the only way to overturn them will be after they're in effect and through the then-legislating body. By moving the debate on the laws to the legislators, it costs the state no money to defend the illegal legislation.

            COUNSELING & CPC

<p><h2>Counseling</h2><!-- <br><img src="img/image_1.jpg" width="400px" height="400px" class="image3"><p class="paragraph3"> -->
>>>>>>> origin/master
<p>Terminating a pregnancy is a difficult choice for anyone to make. Having counseling as an option to both inform and help someone through such an emotional process is an invaluable asset that women seeking abortions should have access to. Mandated counseling goes beyond that, requiring doctors present information that is designed to mislead, discourage, and intimidate. Besides the consequence of simply being misinformed, these laws further infringe on what should make the patient feel in control. They further try to shame the patient for their actions and pit the doctor as the antagonist rather than the ally.  
<p>The issue of mandated counseling is further exacerbated by the overwhelming presence of Crisis Pregnancy Centers in comparison to Abortion Providers. Most major cities have numerous Abortion Clinics with informed doctors, but out in small towns and rural areas CPC's thrive. This is largely by design; CPC's general goal is a ground level reach out to women, and they do provide useful services like free pregancy tests, ultrasounds, diapers, parenting classes, and sometimes even housing. 
<p>Along with those legitimate services CPC's also have a reputation for misinformation and are not medically licensed. When someone is seeking advice on a medical procedure, being told of the links between abortion and breast cancer, when it's been thoroughly documented as “very weak”, is entirely detrimental. Or that “women should be informed that abortion significantly increases risk for” clinical depression, suicidal thoughts, and behavior, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems”, while the American Psychological Association found no such increase from one abortion.
<p>Despite that reputation and approach, CPC's have received $60 million of federal funding and outnumber legitimate Abortion Clinics by about 700. 
Counseling, as with every other service needs to be an option- not a requirement.

<h2>Parental Consent</h2>
>>>>>>> origin/master
<p>The majority of women who have abortions consult or involve at least one parent. As with other abortion related services, it's a great idea to involve a parent to provide comfort and support. In most cases.
<p>The teens who choose not to inform their parents generally have a good reason not to. In those cases, concerns of getting kicked out of the home, mistrust based on parents previous actions, or abuse. While these may be rarer cases, they've been shown to be legitimate.
<p>While all states that mandate parental consent do allow exceptions from a judge or doctor, it is ultimately an unnecessary use of time considering the time sensitivity of when a legal abortion can occur. There is no evidence that mandated consent has an influence on parental involvement. In most cases irrelevant and dangerous in those that it is, there is no reason parental consent should be a mandated law.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<div class = chptrhead><h2>Ultrasound</h2></div>

<section id="ultrasound"></section> 
<h2>Ultrasound</h2>
>>>>>>> origin/master
    <p>The most recent type of legislation regarding abortion has been state's pushing for mandatory ultrasounds. Ultrasounds are a medically safe procedure that involve sending high frequency sound waves through the woman's body to create an image of the baby inside. If a woman is wants more information on her abortion, ultrasounds are a great tool and should be made available.
    <p>However, making the procedure mandatory makes it an unnecessary burden on women who don't want it.

Completed in December 2014. 
<br><br>
Many thanks to Robert Roth, Carl Sack, Rashauna Mead, Sam Matthews, John Czaplewski, etc. for their invaluable help!

This project was built with <a href="http://d3js.org/ ">D3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/queue">Queue</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/ ">jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/ ">Bootstrap</a>.

<h3>Data</h3> <!-- add links --><p>
Overview policy data was collected from the Guttmacher Institute <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf ">here</a>. The A-F grades for each state on the initial map view are from the <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/government-and-you/state-governments/ ">NARAL Pro-choice America's State Government</a> page and the methodology is available <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/government-and-you/who-decides/methodology.html ">here</a>. 
<br><br>
Most of the locations of abortion providers in the U.S. are from <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center ">Planned Parenthood</a> and the <a href="http://prochoice.org/think-youre-pregnant/find-a-provider/ ">National Abortion Federation</a> (NAF). Only those Planned Parenthoods that offer abortion services were included in the map. These locations were cross-checked with NAF's data to ensure that there were no duplicates. A few abortion providers are from <a href="http://www.gynpages.com/ ">GynPages</a> and <a href="http://www.abortionclinicpages.com/ ">abortionclinicpages.com</a>. We know that this is not a comprehensive list of abortion providers in the U.S., as a report from the Guttmacher Institute found that there were an estimated 1,720 abortion providers in the U.S. in 2011 (as opposed to the 607 abortion providers included in our map). However, we could not compile a complete list, as the Guttmacher Institute does not release this information due to confidentiality agreements with many providers. We believe that much of the discrepancy between our number and the complete number is due to hospitals and private physicians' offices that do not belong to the National Abortion Federation. If you have any leads on where we can get a complete list of abortion providers, please <a href="mailto:yourbodynotyourchoice@gmail.com ">contact us</a>. 
<br><br>
The locations of crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) come from <a href="http://birthright.org/">Birthright International</a> and <a href="http://www.heartbeatinternational.org/">Heartbeat International</a> networks. <a href="https://www.care-net.org/">Care-Net</a> also has an extensive network of CPCs but does not have a comprehensive list of their affiliates.
